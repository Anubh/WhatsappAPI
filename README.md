_A simple tool to connect WhatsApp Web to Javascript_

## Terms of use

**YOU WILL NOT USE THIS API, OR PARTS OF IT, TO MASS-MESSAGE, SPAM, AUTO-MESSAGE OR BULK-MESSAGE. YOU WILL NOT SEND MESSAGE TO PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT ON YOUR CONTACT LIST, OR  THAT HAVE MESSAGED YOU BEFORE, WITH A CLEAR PURPOSE TO BE MESSAGED BACK FROM A BOT. YOU WILL EXPLICITLY INFORM YOUR USERS THAT YOU USE AN AUTOMATED SOFTWARE. YOU WILL NOT USE THIS API TO INTERFERE WITH WHATSAPP'S TERMS OF SERVICE. YOU WILL NOT SEND ANY CONTENT THAT VIOLATES WHATSAPP'S TERMS OF SERVICE THROUGH THIS SOFTWARE**

TL;DR: Don't be an a$$hole. WhatsApp is not a product for commercial use. Bots and automation softwares should be used with care - for yourself, for WhatsApp and for your recipients. 

## Get Started

**You can download the WhatsApp API as a Chrome Extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatsapp-api/klddgngdkdljhlhmjdllbdechlnmacik).**

When the WhatsApp web
window loads, the extension will add the API to the page for simple use. Then you can write scripts on WhatsApp web from the Javascript console or using a user script extension (Such as [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo))
